	Navigation:

	 *  Changed markup for main navigation items, so they support not having links on sections.
	    Use <a class="nav-item"> for items with links and <div class="nav-item"> for items with no links

	 *  Changed section title "About Coloplast" to "Coloplast"

	Footer:

	 *  Removed <section class="social"> from footer, due to lack of relevant links

	Video tiles:

	 *  Removed <span class="icon icon-media-playback"> from video tiles. Safety information for overlay
	    is temporarily hardcoded in english in the javascript. This needs to change for phase 2

	 *  Changed link text from "Read more" to "View video"
